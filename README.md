# Prediction-of-Solar-Power-System-Coverage
Task: Predict solar power system coverage The target variable is solar_system_count. This variable is a binary variable indicating the coverage of solar power systems in a given tile. The variable takes outcome low if the tile has a low number of solar power systems (less than or equal to 10), while it takes outcome high if the tile has a large number of solar power systems (more than 10). Use the supervised classification methods described in this course to predict the solar power system coverage of a tile given the collection of predictor features. Use a range of methods and evaluate/discuss their relative merits. In the end, you should base your conclusions and interpretations on the best model you find. Write a report summarising your analysis. Notes: • Some preliminary exploratory analyses and pre-processing could be useful. • Some features are related to households, other to entire areas. Moreover, some features are derived from others. • It is not necessary to include all the predictor variables in the predictive model. Some variables can be discarded upon providing valid motivation and explanation.
